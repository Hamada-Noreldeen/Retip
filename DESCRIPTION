Description:     Retip is an R package for predicting Retention Time (RT) for small molecules 
    in a Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry analysis. 
    Predicted retention time can be useful in identifying unknowns and removing false positive annotations. 
    It uses five different machine learning algorithms to built a stable, accurate and fast RT prediction model.
    Retip also includes useful biochemical databases like: 
    BMDB, ChEBI, DrugBank, ECMDB, FooDB, HMDB, KNApSAcK, PlantCyc, SMPDB, T3DB, UNPD, YMDB and STOFF.
